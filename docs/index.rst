Welcome to SpiffExample Documentation
============================================================

What is SpiffExample?
---------------------

SpiffExample is a sample implementation of SpiffWorkflow. SpiffWorkflow is a workflow engine written in Python, based on the `Workflow Patterns <http://www.workflowpatterns.com/>`__ initiative. This document focuses on using SpiffWorkflow to create business applications from Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) documents.

What is Business Process Model and Notation?
--------------------------------------------

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a diagramming language for business process flows. BPMN links the realms of business and IT, and creates a common process language that can be shared between the two.

BPMN describes details of process behaviors efficiently in a diagram. The meaning is precise enough to describe the technical details that control process execution in an automation engine. SpiffWorkflow allows you to create code to get a BPMN up and running.

When using SpiffWorkflow, a client can manipulate the BPMN diagram and still have their product work without a need for you to edit the Python code, improving response and turnaround time.

Today, nearly every process modeling tool supports BPMN in some fashion making it a great tool to learn and use.
