Welcome to Business Process Model and Notation Documentation
============================================================

What is Business Process Model and Notation?
--------------------------------------------


Business Process Model and Notation  also known as BPMN is a diagramming language for business process flows. BPMN links
the realms of business and IT, and creates a common process language that can be shared between the two.  BPMN is able
to describe details of process behaviors efficiently in a diagram, while at same time, the meaning is precise enough to
describe the technical details that control process execution in an automation engine! So, what does this mean? As a
software engineer you create code (hyperlink to example code) which can be used to get a BPMN up and running.
When the client wants to manipulate the BPMN diagram they can still get their product to work without you having to
always make drastic or in some cases any changes to the code. For example if the client later wants to change the order
in which they do the workflow they are able to do so without you having to go back in and change the code. This saves
you the hassle of having to go in and make every change manually, and allows for the client to get what they want, when
they want it. Allowing an Improvement in response and turnaround time. Today, nearly every process modeling tool
supports BPMN in some fashion making it a great tool to learn and use.Isnâ€™t that Great!
